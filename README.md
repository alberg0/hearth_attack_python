# hearth_attack_python
This repository analyzes a dataset containing information from 5000 individuals, aiming to uncover factors influencing the likelihood of a heart attack. It employs data exploration, transformation, and modeling techniques to identify significant features and visualize key insights from the research.

## Notes
- BMI Imputation has been chosen over data drop as too many observation presenting a positive target value were involved. A Gaussian random distribution has been chosen to impute the values. This process can be methodologically improved by verifying that the sample is compatible with a Gaussian distribution (e.g. [Shapiro-Wilk test]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test#:~:text=A%20normality%20test%20is%20used,a%20normally%20distributed%20sample%20population.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test#:~:text=A%20normality%20test%20is%20used,a%20normally%20distributed%20sample%20population.))
- Smoking Level has been imputed with a [K-Nearest Neighbors imputer]([url](https://medium.com/@kyawsawhtoon/a-guide-to-knn-imputation-95e2dc496e)https://medium.com/@kyawsawhtoon/a-guide-to-knn-imputation-95e2dc496e). This algorithm allows to impute qualitative values by looking at similar observations.
- Looking at the model's statistics, it's easy to conclude that the logistic regression does not fit the data.
- The Decision Tree has been adopted due to its interpretability. In this kind of observations, feature importance can be preferable to perfect model fit. One future improvement will be to implement model diagnostic, to quantify the model's fit to the data.
